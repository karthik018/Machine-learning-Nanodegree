Environment Setup:
This project uses python 3.6
some python libraries used are:
1. ipython, jupyter: for development within notebooks.
2. numpy, scipy: as common and core scientific libraries.
3. Pandas: for working with data frames and series.
4. Scikit-learn: for machine learning functionality.
5. Matplotlib, seaborn: for data visualizations.
All these python libraries can be installed using pip3 for python 3.6
Additionally, graphviz, a non-python library and related pydotplus, a python library, were used for visualization of graphs that is for example a decision tree.

Data:
The data for this project is included in the submission.
It is also available to download from Kaggle at:

Development:
All coding and development was performed using python jupyter notebook.
The notebook covering all the stages of work is capstone_project.ipynb.
Most code within the notebooks runs quickly, within a 2-3 seconds at most. The exception is the grid search in the third notebook. With n_jobs set to 4 it ran in 3 minutes 49 seconds using a laptop with i3 processor with 8 GB RAM.
